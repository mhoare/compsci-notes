# Single and Multi-dimensional arrays

*Use arrays (or equivalent) in the design of solutions 
to simple problems*

## What is an array?
An array is a collection of data items of the same data type. 
Each item can be accessed directly via it's index (position in the array).

Array access is very fast as each element can be accessed directly.

## What is a multi-dimensional array?
A multi-dimensional array is an array with more than one dimension. Think of it as a series of arrays inside of eachother.

An *n*-dimensional array can be represented mathematically as an *n*-dimensional matrix.

### Uses of a multi-dimensional array
A multi-dimensional array may be used when representing a matrix.
