Stack
=====

A stack is a data type that operates on either a **last-in first-out (LIFO)** or **first-in first-out (FIFO) **principle.

Items can either be added to or removed from the top of the stack.

A *pointer* indicates the top of the stack.![](resources/7F130E02A33C129A9075688992AD984A.jpg)

Uses of a stack
---------------

* Calling procedures in programs
* Recursive calculations
* Reversing array items
* Performing *reverse polish* calculations
* Holding return addresses and system states for recursive function calls

When a routine is called, the computer allocates memory in the stack.

Each time a procedure is called by another procedure, it is pushed onto the stack.

When a function is used, the returned value is allocated to a variable; the variableâ€™s memory location is stored to the **stack frame**.

At the end of a routine, the value is stored to the return address, control is passed back to the main function and stack frame is removed from the stack.
