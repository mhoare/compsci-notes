> Know that a rooted tree is a tree in which one
> vertex has been designated as the root. A rooted
> tree has parent-child relationships between
> nodes. The root is the only node with no parent
> and all other nodes are descendants of the root. 

> Know that a binary tree is a rooted tree in which
> each node has at most two children.

> *A common application of a binary tree is as a
> binary search tree.*
