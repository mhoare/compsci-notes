# Hash Tables

## What is a hash table

> Be familiar with the concept of a hash table and
> its uses.

A hash table is a data structure that creates a
mapping between keys and values.

A hash function takes a key and performs a series of operations on it to produce a hash. The value is then stored against this hash in the table.

## Uses of hash tables

Hash tables are often used to implement other in memory data structures such as associative arrays. Additionally they are used a lot in database indexing and caching.

## Exam

> Be able to apply simple hashing algorithms.

## Collisions

> Know what is meant by a collision and how
> collisions are handled using rehashing.

A collision occurs when two key values compute
the same hash.

### Rehashing

Rehashing is when a new, larger, table is created and the values are hashed into that table. The new table must use a new hash function.

1. Make larger table
2. Go through old hash table ignoring empty slots
3. Recompute the hash value and put in new position in new table

### Linear Probing

In linear probing, after a collision has occurred, the table is scanned until the next available slot is found. Then the value is stored against that key.
