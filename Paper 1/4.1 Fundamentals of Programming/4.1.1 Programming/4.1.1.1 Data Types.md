# Programming Data Types

> Understand the concept of a data type

A data type is a particular kind of data item. It is defined by the values it can take, the programming language used, or the operations that can be performed on it.

> Understand and use data types appropriately

## Generic Data Types:

* Integer
* Real / Float
* Text / String
* Boolean
* Character
* Date / Time
* Records (a collection of related data items of different types)
* Array (a collection of data items of the same type)
* Pointer (a reference to a specific location in memory)

| Data type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Integer | Positive/negative whole number `e.g. -2, 1, 0` |
| Real/float | Number that has a fractional or decimal part `e.g. 3.5, 3â…“` |
| Text/string | Combination of characters, either text and/or numbers `e.g. "+44 1632 960445", "Marc"` |
| Boolean | Data with only 2 possible values `e.g. true/false, yes/no, black/white` |
| Character | Single character, either a letter, number or symbol `e.g. 'a', '#'` |
| Date/time | Data representing a date or time `e.g. 30.04.2014 or 12:30` |
| Records | A collection of related data items, where all items have different data types `e.g. record called Book, will store title, publication date, price etc.` |
| Array | Collection of data items of same type `e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4] or ["apple", "banana", "cactus"]` |
| Pointer | A reference to a specific location in memory `e.g. 0x8130` |

## *Additional information*

> Variables declared as a pointer or reference data
> type are used as stores for memory addresses
> of objects created at runtime, ie dynamically.
> Not all languages support explicit pointer types,
> but students should have an opportunity to
> understand this data type.
