# Object oriented programming

## Design Principles
> Be aware of the following object-oriented design
> principles:
> * encapsulate what varies
> * favour composition over inheritance
> * program to interfaces, not implementation.


#### *Additional Information*
> Students would benefit from practical experience
> of programming to an interface, but will not be
> explicitly tested on programming to interfaces
> or be required to program to interfaces in any
> practical exam.

## Instance Methods

An object is an instance of a class.

Instance methods include:
* Constructors
* Accessors (*Getters*)
* Mutators (*Setters*)

### Abstract Methods
* Consists of only a signature but no implementation
* Used to speicify that a subclass must provide an implemenatation of the method
* Used to specify interfaces in some languages

*The actual method is not supplied in the base class, which means that it must be provided in the subclass. 
In this case, the object is being used as an interface between the method and the data.*

### Virtual Method
* Implementation can be redefined by subclasses
* Overridable

*The method is defined in the case class but can be overridden by the method in the subclass where it will be used. 
This is a feature of polymorhpism.*

### Static method
* Relelvant to all instances of a class rather than to any specific instance
* Has no owning object and does not run on an instance
* Receives all information from its arguments.

*The method can be used without an object of the class being instantiated.*
