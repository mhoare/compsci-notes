# Comparing algorithms

> Understand that algorithms can be compared by
> expressing their complexity as a function relative
> to the size of the problem. Understand that the
> size of the problem is the key issue.


## Efficiency
> Understand that some algorithms are more
> efficient:
> * time-wise than other algorithms
> * space-wise than other algorithms.

#### *Additional information*

> Efficiently implementing automated abstractions
> means designing data models and algorithms to
> run quickly while taking up the minimal amount of
> resources such as memory.
