When comparing an algorithm that has time complexity O( n ) and space complexity O( n<sup>2</sup>) with another algorithm which has time complexity O( n<sup>2</sup> ) and space complexity O( n ), it is clear to see that the first is more time efficient whereas the second is more space efficient.

There are benefits to improving time complexity and space complexity and some algorithm prefer to improve space complexity over time complexity.

As the above diagram shows, some more complex algorithms may be more efficient than less complex algorithms for small input sizes, however once a certain size is surpassed, the functions diverge rapidly.
