## What are Turing machines?

The Turing machine is considered the blueprint for modern computers.
It defines what is *computable*.

## Structure

A basic Turing machine consists of a read/write head, and an infinitely long tape which is divided into squares.
Each square contains a character.
The read/write head can read data from and write data to the tape.

A Turing machine must have a start state, and *at least one* **halting** state, that causes the machine to halt for some inputs.

Any alphabet of symbols may be used but we will generally use only a binary alphabet of 0, 1 and  (representing a blank).

## The Controller

The controller is a finite state machine which tells the machine what to do next.

In any one transition, the machine can:
* Read the symbol on the tape
* Erase or write a new symbol on the tape
* Move the head left or right by a single space

It provides a definition of what is computable.

It can be priven mathematically that a Turing machine is capable of computing anything that is computable. 

### How many Turing machines?

A Turing machine:

* is a general model of computation
* can be define to represent any computation

However, a different Turing machine would be needed for each individual operation

Turing came up with the idea of a *Universal Turing Machine*.

#### Universal Turing Machines

The Universal Turing Machine reads from the tape:
* the definition of a Turing Machine `T`
* the input data `D`

Using this, the UTM can simulate the behaviour of *any* Turing machine.

The UTM was the breakthrough that led to the idea of the stored program computer.

**Differences between UTM and Turing Machine**

A Turing machine can only represent one program, whereas the UTM can perform any operation as it reads the instructions in as well as the data.
