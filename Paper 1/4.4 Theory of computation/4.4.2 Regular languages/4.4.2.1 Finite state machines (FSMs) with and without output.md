## What is a Finite State Machine?

A finite state machine is an abstract machine which can be in exactly one of a *finite* number of *states* at any given time.

## What are the uses of FSM?

## Outputs

FSMs can have outputs but this is not required. Those that do not have outputs are known as **Finite State Automata** (FSA).
