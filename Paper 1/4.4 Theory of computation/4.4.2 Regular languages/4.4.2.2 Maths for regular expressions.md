# Maths for regular expressions

## What is a set?

A set is an unordered collection of values in which
each value occurs at most once.

**Notation for specifying a set**
```
A = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
```

**Notation for specifying a set comprehension**
```
A = { x | x ∈ N ^ x ≥ 1 }
```

## Set comprehension

Sets can be defined using set comprehension.
This defines the properties that a set should have.

Below is a table explaining each of the symbols in the above example.

| Symbol | Explanation |
| :----: | :---------- |
| `x` | Represents the values of the set |
| `\|` | The equation that follows this defines the value of x |
| `∈` | Indicates that x is a member of `N` |
| `N` | Used to represent the natural numbers |
| `^` | Used to represent 'and' |

## Why sets?

Sets formalise the idea of grouping objects together and viewing them as a single entity. This means that sets become an abstraction.

There is a close relationship between set theory and logic. The laws governing sets form part of the basis for boolean algebra.
