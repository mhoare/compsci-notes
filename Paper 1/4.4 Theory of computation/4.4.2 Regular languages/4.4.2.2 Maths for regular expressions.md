# Maths for regular expressions

## What is a set?

A set is an unordered collection of values in which
each value occurs at most once.

**Notation for specifying a set**
```
A = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
```

**Notation for specifying a set comprehension**
```
A = { x | x ∈ N ^ x ≥ 1 }
```

## Set comprehension

Sets can be defined using set comprehension.
This defines the properties that a set should have.

Below is a table explaining each of the symbols in the above example.

| Symbol | Explanation |
| :----: | :---------- |
| `x` | Represents the values of the set |
| `\|` | The equation that follows this defines the value of x |
| `∈` | Indicates that x is a member of `N` |
| `N` | Used to represent the natural numbers |
| `^` | Used to represent 'and' |

## Why sets?

Sets formalise the idea of grouping objects together and viewing them as a single entity. This means that sets become an abstraction.

There is a close relationship between set theory and logic. The laws governing sets form part of the basis for boolean algebra.

## Compact set representation

A set can be defined by a shorthand method read the same way as set comprehension.

**Set comprehension:**
```
S = {x | x ∈ N ^ x is even}
```

**Compact representation:**
```
S = {x ∈ N | x is even}
```

**Compact representation for strings:**
<pre><code>S = { 0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>n</sup> | n >= 1 }</code></pre>

The above compact representation for strings will define a set that has an strings with an equal number of 0's and 1's.
