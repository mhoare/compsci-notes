## Context free languages

Regular expressions can be used to represent the syntax of languages which use a simple syntax;
however they are not suitable for languages with complex syntax.

Context free languages are used to represent syntax rules of languages with complex syntax.

**Backus-Naur Form (BNF)** is an example of a context-free language.

## BNF Notation

| Notation | Meaning |
| :------: | :------ |
| < > | Encloses each element |
| ::= | Defines the rule for a previous element |
| \| | Or | 
| { } | Encloses optional elements |

**Example**

The production rule below shows that the student-details must include the following elements:
* name
* address
* gender
```
<student-details> ::= <name> <address> <gender>
```

### Terminal Elements

Each element should be broken down further until a terminal is reached; 
this is an element that can't be broken down any further.

In the first example below, `gender` is the only terminal element as each of the other elements can be broken down further.

**Example**

```
<name> ::= <first-name> <middle-name> <last-name>
<address> ::= <street> <town> <county> <post-code>
<gender> ::= "M" | "F"
```

**Example 2**

```
<digit> ::= 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9
<upper> ::= A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z
<lower> ::= a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n|o|p|q|r|s|t|u|v|w|x|y|z
<space> ::= ' '
<letter> ::= <upper>|<lower>
<string> ::= <letter>|<letter><string>
```

## Syntax Diagrams

A syntax diagram is another method of representing a context-free language.

### Symbols

| Symbol | Use |
| :----- | :-- |
| ![](resources/rectangle.png) | Used to represent a non-terminal element |
| ![](resources/ellipse.png) | Used to represent a terminal element | 
| ![](resources/repeating.png) | Used to represent a non-terminal element that can be reused |

BNF really shines once you have a solid syntax definition as you can then use the tools to
rigorously parse the syntax it describes.
