## Bredth-first

### Tracing breadth-first

### Applications of bredth-first search

* Shortest Path and Minimum Spanning Tree for unweighted graph
* P2P networks - used to find all neighbour nodes
* Social Networking Websites - finding people who are *k* away from you (friend of a friend etc)

## Depth-first

### Tracing depth-first

### Applications of depth-first search

* Solving puzzles with only one solution - e.g. mazes
* Detecting cycle in a graph - A graph has cycle if and only if we see a back edge during DFS. So we can run DFS for the graph and check for back edges.
