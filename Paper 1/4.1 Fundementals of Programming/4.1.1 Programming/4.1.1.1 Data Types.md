# Programming Data Types

> Understand the concept of a data type

A data type is a particular kind of data item. It is defined by the values it can take, the programming language used, or the operations that can be performed on it.

> Understand and use data types appropriately

## Generic Data Types:

* Integer
* Real / Float
* Text / String
* Boolean
* Character
* Date / Time
* Records (a collection of related data items of different types)
* Array (a collection of data items of the same type)
* Pointer (a reference to a specific location in memory)

## *Additional information*

> Variables declared as a pointer or reference data
> type are used as stores for memory addresses
> of objects created at runtime, ie dynamically.
> Not all languages support explicit pointer types,
> but students should have an opportunity to
> understand this data type.
