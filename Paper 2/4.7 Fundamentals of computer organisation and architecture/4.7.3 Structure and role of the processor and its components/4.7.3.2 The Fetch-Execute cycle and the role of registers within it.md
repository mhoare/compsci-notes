# The Fetch-Execute cycle and the role of registers within it

> Explain how the Fetch-Execute cycle is used to execute machine code programs including the stages in the cycle (fetch, decode, execute) and details of registers used.

## Fetch:
* Contents of Program Counter transferred to Memory Address Register
* Address bus used to transfer this address to main memory
* Contents of addressed memory location loaded into the Memory Buffer Register
* Transfer of content uses the data bus
* Increment contents of Program Counter
* Increment Program Counter and fetch simultaneously 
* Transfer content of Memory Buffer Register to the Current Instruction Register

## Decode: 
* Decode instruction held by the Current Instruction Register
* The control unit decodes the instruction
* Instruction split into opcode and operand

## Execute:
* If necessary, data is fetched
* The opcode identifies the type of instruction it is
* Execute instruction by relevant part of processor
* Result stored in accumulator
* Status register updated;
* If jump / branch instruction Program Counter is updated
