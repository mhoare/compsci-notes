# The Fetch-Execute cycle and the role of registers within it

> Explain how the Fetch-Execute cycle is used to execute machine code programs including the stages in the cycle (fetch, decode, execute) and details of registers used.

## Fetch:
1. Contents of Program Counter transferred to Memory Address Register
  * Address bus used to transfer this address to main memory
2. Contents of addressed memory location loaded into the Memory Buffer Register
  * Transfer of content uses the data bus
3. Increment contents of Program Counter
  * Increment Program Counter and fetch simultaneously 
4. Transfer content of Memory Buffer Register to the Current Instruction Register

## Decode: 
5. Decode instruction held by the Current Instruction Register
6. The control unit decodes the instruction
7. Instruction split into opcode and operand

## Execute:
8. If necessary, data is fetched
  * The opcode identifies the type of instruction it is
7. Execute instruction by relevant part of processor
  * Result stored in accumulator
8. Status register updated;
  * If jump / branch instruction Program Counter is updated
