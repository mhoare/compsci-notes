# The processor instruction set

> Understand the term ‘processor instruction set’
and know that an instruction set is processor
specific.

The instruction set of a typical computer includes the following types of instructions:
* Data transfer such as `LOAD` and `STORE`
* Arithmetic operations such as `ADD` and  `SUBTRACT`
* Comparison operators such as equal, greater than, less than
* Logical operations `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` and `XOR`
* Branching conditional and unconditional
* Logical shift bits left or right

> Know that instructions consist of an opcode and
one or more operands (value, memory address or
register).

Opcode
* The part of a machine code instruction, that represents a basic machine operation.

Operand
* The part of the machine code instruction that contains an item of binary data or address in which the binary data is stored
* Operands can have immediate and direct addressing modes
  * Immediate – actual datum value in operand is operated on. `e.g. #5 means the number 5 is operated on`
  * Direct - holds the memory address of the datum value to be operated on. `e.g. 5 means memory address 5 is operated on`

## Additional Information
> Students will not be expected to define
opcode, only interpret opcodes in the given
context of a question

* Logic shift can be used for multiplication/division by any power of 2.
