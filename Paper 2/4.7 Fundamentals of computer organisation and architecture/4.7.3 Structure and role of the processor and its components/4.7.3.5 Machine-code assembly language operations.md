| Operation | AQA Assembly Instruction | Explanation |
| :-------: | :----------------------- | :---------- |
| Load | `LDR Rd, <memory ref>` | Load the data in the specified location into register `d` |
| Add | `ADD Rd, Rn, <operand>` | Add the value in register `n` to the value of the operand (may be a decimal value or a memory location), and store the result in register `d` |
| Subtract | `SUB Rd, Rn, <operand>` | Subtract the value specified by `<operand>` to the value in register `n` and store the result in register `d` |
| Store | `STR Rd, <memory ref>` | Store the value of register `d` in the specified memory address |
| Branch (Unconditional) | `B <label>` | Always branch (jump) to the instruction at position `<label>` in the program |
| Branch (Conditional) | `B<condition> <label>` | Branch to the instruction at position `<label>` if the condition is met |
| Compare | `CMP Rn, <operand>` | Compare the value of register `n` with the operand |
| AND | | |
| OR | | |
| NOT | | |
| XOR | | |
| Logical Shift Right | | |
| Logical Shift Left | | |
| Halt | | |
