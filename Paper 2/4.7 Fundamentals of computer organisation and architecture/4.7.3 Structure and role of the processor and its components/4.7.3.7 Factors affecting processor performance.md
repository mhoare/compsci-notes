# Factors affecting processor performance
> Explain the effect on processor performance of:
* multiple cores
* cache memory
* clock speed
* word length
* address bus width
* data bus width.

Multiple cores
* Increase in processing power as instructions can be executed in parallel and does not have same power requirements as 1 large core.

Cache memory
* More data can be stored closer to the CPU so instructions are executed faster.

Clock speed
* The frequency at which a clock pulse occurs, increasing the clock speed will increase the speed at which instructions are executed.

Word length
* Increases the number of bits of information that a processor can process at one time.

Address bus length
* Increases the number of memory addresses possible e.g. from 24 bits to 32 bits. Determines the maximum possible memory capacity of the system.

Data bus length
* Increasing the width increases the number of bits that can be transferred at one time.

## Additional information
* A word is a fixed size group of digits which is handled as a unit by the processor and different types of process have different word sizes. Each word in memory has its own specific address.
