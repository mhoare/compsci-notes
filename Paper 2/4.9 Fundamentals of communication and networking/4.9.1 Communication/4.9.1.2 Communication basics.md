# Communication basics

> Define:
* baud rate
* bit rate
* bandwidth
* latency
* protocol

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Baud rate | Number of signal changes per second. |
| Bit rate | Number of bits transferred per second |
| Bandwidth | A range of frequencies within a given band used for transmission of a signal |
| Latency | Time delay between the moment something is initiated and the moment its effect begins |
| Protocol | A set of rules about the way devices communicate. Needed to ensure successful transmission between different computers. |

> Differentiate between baud rate and bit rate.

Bit rate can be higher than baud rate if more than one bit is encoded in each signal change.
* Bit rate is **number of bits transferred per second.**
* Baud rate is **number of signal changes per second.**

>Understand the relationship between bit rate and
bandwidth.

* Bit rate and bandwidth are directly proportional. 
* The greater the bandwidth, the higher the bit rate. 

## Additional information
* The bandwidth is usually double the bit rate so the relationship can be seen as 2:1 as a ratio.
