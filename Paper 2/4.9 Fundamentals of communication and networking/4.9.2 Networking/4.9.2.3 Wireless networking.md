# Networking

> Explain the purpose of WiFi. 

* A wireless local area network that is based on international standards.
* Used to enable devices to connect to a network
wirelessly.

> Be familiar with the components required for
wireless networking.

Wireless network adapter.
* A device that enables devices to connect to a network wirelessly

Wireless access point
* Device that allows a Wi-Fi compliant device to connect to a wired network

> Be familiar with how wireless networks are
secured.

* Strong encryption of transmitted data using WPA (WiFi Protected Access)/WPA2

* SSID (Service Set Identifier) broadcast disabled - can be seen as a security weakness.

* MAC (Media Access Control) address white list

> Explain the wireless protocol Carrier Sense
Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/
CA) with and without Request to Send/Clear to
Send (RTS/CTS).

* CSMA/CA with RTS/CTS

1. Request to send
2. Check if channel idle
  1. No - wait arbitrary amount of time
  2. Yes - transmit data

* CSMA/CA without RTS/CTS

1. Request to send
2. Clear to send

> Be familiar with the purpose of Service Set
Identifier (SSID).

Service Set Identifier (SSID).
* Locally unique identifier for a wireless network
* A wireless client must have the same SSD as the one entered in the access point to join

## Additional information
* CSMA/CA without RTS/CTS prevents the effect of hidden nodes
