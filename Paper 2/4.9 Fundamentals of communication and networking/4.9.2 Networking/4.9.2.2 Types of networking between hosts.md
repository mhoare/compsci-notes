# Types of networking between hosts

> Explain the following and describe situations where they might be used:
* peer-to-peer networking
* client-server networking.

##Â Peer-to-peer networking
* No dedicated servers
* All computers have equal status
* Each computer functions as both a client and server
* User at each computer acts as both a user and an administrator
  * determining what data, disk space and peripherals on their computer get shared on the network

## Client-server networking
* A network methodology where one computer has the main processing power and storage - the server.
* The other computers act as clients requesting services from the server e.g. email, printing and files.

## Additional information
>In a peer-to-peer network, each computer has
equal status. In a client-server network, most
computers are nominated as clients and one or
more as servers. The clients request services
from the servers, which provide these services,
for example file server, email server.

Client-server based networking is better than peer-to-peer for things like an office school network because:
* System will be storing confidential data
* There is centralised administration
* Harder for users to change settings
* Centralised backup
* Running database from a server will avoid concurrency issues
