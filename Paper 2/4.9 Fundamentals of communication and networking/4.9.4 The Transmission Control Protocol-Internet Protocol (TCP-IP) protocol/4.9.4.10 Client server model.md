| :---------: | :---------: | :----------: |
| GET | Retreive | `SELECT` |
| POST | Create | `INSERT` |
| PUT | Update | `UPDATE` |
| DELETE | Delete | `DELETE` |

####*Additional Information*
> The Websocket specification defines an API
> (Application Programming Interface) establishing
> a full-duplex 'socket' connection between a web
> browser and a server over TCP. This means that
> there is a persistent connection between client
> and server, allowing both parties to send data at
> any time.
