| Processor Instruction Set | The set of instructions which can run on a processor. | Each instruction set is processor specific. |
| Baud rate | Baud rate is the number of signal changes per second. | |
| Bit rate | Bit rate is the number of bits transferred per second. | Bit rate can be higher than baud rate if more than one bit is encoded in each signal change. |
| Bandwidth | A range of frequencies within a given band used for transmission of a signal. | Bit rate is directly proportionate to bandwidth. |
| Latency | Time delay between the moment something is initiated and the moment its effect begins. | |
| Protocol | A set of rules about the way devices communicate. Needed to ensure successful transmission between different computers. | |
