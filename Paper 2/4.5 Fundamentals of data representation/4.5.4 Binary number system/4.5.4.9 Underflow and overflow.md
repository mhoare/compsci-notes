## Underflow

Underflow is when a number is too small to be represented in the given number of bits. Usually occurs when a very small number is subtracted from a very large number, or a large number is divided by a much larger number.

## Overflow

Overflow is when a number is too large to be represented in the given number of bits. Usually occurs when two large numbers are added together.
