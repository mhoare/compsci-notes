## Why are fp numbers normalised?

Normalisation of floating point numbers is the process of moving the binary digit so that the first digit after the point is a significant digit. 
This maximises precision in a given number of bits.
The bits before and after the binary point will be different in a normalised floating point number.

**Example**

A negative number in floating point representation will have a mantissa starting with:
```
1.0.....
```

and a positive number will start with:
```
0.1.............
```
