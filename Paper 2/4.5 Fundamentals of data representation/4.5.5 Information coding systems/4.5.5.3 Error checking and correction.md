## Parity Bits

Parity bits are ...

They are used ...

There is both one dimensional and two dimensional parity checks. 
A 1D parity check adds a single bit to a message (usually one byte) whereas a 2D parity check adds a single bit to every byte and then a parity byte where each bit is a parity bit for the columns. 
This allows correction of particular bits since their location can be determined.

## Majority Voting

Majority voting is an error checking method where is bit / byte is send a number of times and the bit / byte takes the most frequent value. 

**Example**

To send the message:
``` 
1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
```

It may be sent as
```
111 000 111 111 000 000 111 000
```
or
```
10110010 10110010 10110010
```
