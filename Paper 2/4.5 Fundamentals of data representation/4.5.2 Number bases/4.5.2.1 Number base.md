Binary is base 2 meaning that only a `0` or a `1` can be used to represent numbers.

Decimal is base 10, meaning the numbers 0-9 are used to represent numbers (this is the standard base).

Hexadecimal is base 16, since there are only 10 numbers the final 16 must be made up using letters. The set used to represent hexadecimal is as follows: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F}
