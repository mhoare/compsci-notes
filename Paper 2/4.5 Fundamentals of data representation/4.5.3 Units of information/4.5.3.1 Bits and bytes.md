A bit is the fundamental unit of information and is represented as either a `0` or `1`. A group of 8 bits is called a byte.

## Values which can the be represented

2<sup>n</sup> different values can be represented using n bits 
however the maximum value is 2<sup>n</sup> - 1.

**Example**

The 8 values which can be represented using 3 bits are:

| Value | Binary |
| :---: | :----: |
| 0 | 000 |
| 1 | 001 |
| 2 | 010 |
| 3 | 011 |
| 4 | 100 |
| 5 | 101 |
| 6 | 110 |
| 7 | 111 |
