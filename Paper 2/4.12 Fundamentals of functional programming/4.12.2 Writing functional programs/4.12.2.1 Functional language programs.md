## Higher order functions

A function is higher-order if it takes a function as an
argument or returns a function as a result, or does
both.

### Examples of higher order functions

| Function | Use | Example |
| :------: | :-: | :------ |
| map | Applying a function to every element in a list | `map (+2) [1..10]` - adds two to every element |
| filter | Filtering a list based on a provided function | `filter (<5) [1..10]` - returns elements less than 5 |
| reduce / fold | Reduces a list of values to a single value by applying a combining function to the list | |
