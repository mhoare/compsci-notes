# Functional Lists

## Head and Tail

> Be familiar with representing a list as a
> concatenation of a head and a tail.

### What is a head and what is a tail?

The head of the list is defined to be the first element of the list.
The tail of the list is defined to be a list excluding the head, the type of `tail` is therefore a list of elements.

### Example

| Original List | Head | Tail |
| :-----------: | :--: | :--: |
| x:xs | x | xs |
| [1,2,3,4,5] | 1 | [2,3,4,5] |

### Head and tail concatination

A list can be represented as a head and tail concatination.
For example the list `[1,2,3,4,5]` could be represented as `1:[2,3,4,5]`.

## List operations

> Know that a list can be empty.

> `[]` is the empty list.

> Describe and apply the following operations:
> * return head of list
> * return tail of list
> * test for empty list
> * return length of list
> * construct an empty list
> * prepend an item to a list
> * append an item to a list.

| Operation | Description | Example |
| :-------- | :------ | :----- |
| Return head of list | | [Head Example](#return-head-of-list) |
| Return tail of list | | [Tail Example](#return-tail-of-list) |
| Test for empty list | | [Empty Example](#test-for-empty-list) |
| Return length of list | | [Length Example](#length-of-list) |
| Prepend an item to a list | | [Prepend Example](#prepend-to-list) |
| Append an item to a list | | [Append Example](#append-to-list) |

### Return head of list
```haskell
headOfList (x:xs) = 
	x
```

### Return tail of list
```haskell
tailOfList (x:xs) = 
	xs
```

### Test for empty list
```haskell
checkEmptyList l = 
	null l
```

### Length of list
```haskell
lengthOfList l = 
	length l
```

### Prepend to list
```haskell
prependToList i l = 
	i:l
```

### Append to list
```haskell
appendToList i l =
	l ++ [i]	
```

#### *Additional Information*

> For example, in Haskell the list [4, 3, 5] can be
> written in the form head:tail where head is the first
> item in the list and tail is the remainder of the list.
> In the example, we have 4:[3, 5]. We call 4 the
> head of the list and [3, 5] the tail.
