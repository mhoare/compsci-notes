## What is function application?

Function application is the the process of giving particular inputs to a function.

## Example

```
add (x, y)

add (3,4)
```

In the above example, the add function is *applied* to the arguments `3` and `4`. 

#### *Additional Information*

> Although we would say that function `add` takes two
> arguments, in fact it takes only one argument,
> which is a pair, for example (3,4).
