## What is partial application?

Partial application is the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function 
and then producing another function which only takes the remaining arguments.

## Why is partial application used?

Partial application is used to make a general function more specific allowing
it to be used with greater ease in the program.

## Example

```haskell
add x y = 
	x + y
```

In the example below, the add function takes two arguments and returns their sum.
Say you wanted to add 2 to a number a user gives you? 
You don't want to have to pass the argument `2` into the add function again and again. Instead you could partially apply the add function to the value `2`.

```haskell
addTwo = add 2
```

Now the `addTwo` function takes one argument and add's 2 to it.
