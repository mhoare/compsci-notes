# First-class Objects

> Know that a function is a first-class object in
> functional programming languages and in
> imperative programming languages that support
> such objects. This means that it can be an
> argument to another function as well as the result
> of a function call.

When calling a function, the name given to a type of object which can be passed in or returned is *first-class object*. 

A first class object is any object / value which may:
* appear in expressions
* be assigned to a variable
* be assigned as arguments
* be returned in function calls

## Examples of First Class Objects

1. Integer
2. Floating-point values
3. Characters
4. Strings

## First Class Objects in Functional Programming

In functional languages, functions are treated as first class objects.

This is what enables ideas such as *currying* and *partial application* to become reality.
