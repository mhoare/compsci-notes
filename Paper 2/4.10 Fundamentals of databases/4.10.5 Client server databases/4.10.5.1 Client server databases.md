Concurrent access can result in the problem of
updates being lost if two clients edit a record at
the same time. This problem can be managed by
the use of: 
* record locks
* serialisation
* timestamp ordering
* commitment ordering

### Record Locks
Information about which records are currently being accessed will be maintained.
When a user tries to access a record, check this information and only permit access if the record is not currently being used.

### Transaction queueing
Database changes are grouped as transactions and queued. 
Database software processes the queue (FIFO).
